/*
Enhancements to the Note Component:

1. Security Improvement:
   - Replaced the JavaScript `eval()` function with the `evaluate` function from `mathjs`. This change significantly enhances security by safely evaluating mathematical expressions without the risk of executing arbitrary JavaScript code. `mathjs` is specifically designed to interpret and calculate mathematical expressions, mitigating potential code injection vulnerabilities inherent in `eval()`.

2. Error Handling:
   - Implemented robust error handling using a try/catch block around the mathematical expression evaluation. This approach ensures that any errors in the evaluation process, such as syntax errors or undefined mathematical operations, are caught and handled gracefully. It prevents the application from crashing due to unexpected inputs and informs the user about the error in a non-technical, friendly manner.

3. User Feedback:
   - Enhanced user feedback for both successful evaluations and errors. Upon successful evaluation, the result is displayed in an alert with a clear message. If an error occurs, a descriptive message is shown, guiding the user to input a correctly formatted mathematical expression. This not only improves the user experience but also aids in understanding how to use the application correctly.

By focusing on security and user experience, these changes make the Note component safer and more user-friendly. Ensuring that mathematical expressions are evaluated securely while providing clear and informative feedback to the user enhances the overall functionality and integrity of the application.
